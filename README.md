# How does climate change impact property values?
In my research, I wanted to investigate whether climate change is having any impact on the real estate market in my parents’ community. In finance terms, what I’m investigating is whether climate risk is ‘priced in;’ whether people are incorporating the risk of climate change into their decision-making when they’re deciding whether to buy a house and how much to pay for it.

One way that risks get incorporated into markets is through insurance. Insurance companies stay in business by charging a little more to people at higher risk of making a claim, like someone with a lot of speeding tickets or a family history of heart problems. The same principle applies to flood insurance; the riskier the home being insured, the higher the payment. And just like how all drivers are required to buy car insurance, everyone who owns a home in a high-risk area is legally required to buy flood insurance.

This makes flood insurance prices a pretty good yardstick of climate risk in coastal areas. Here’s a trivia question: who’s the largest flood insurance provider in the country? It’s not Geico. It’s not Allstate. It’s actually the federal government. FEMA created the National Flood Insurance Program in the 1970s to offset the cost of rebuilding after natural disasters. In the late 2010s, when they updated their pricing models, they realized that they had been significantly underpricing risk in certain areas. However, they are only allowed to raise the price of insurance by 15% per year, so it will take as many as 10 years for some of these properties to be paying an insurance premium which accurately reflects the home’s risk of flooding.

I created these two maps using public FEMA data and files I obtained from the county tax appraiser’s office.

In this map, we can see that the accurate insurance premiums will be double, triple, or even quintuple the current rates in Collier County. We can thus take the darkest red areas on this map to be the riskiest ones.

When you compare it with this map of home prices you see that many of the riskiest properties are in the most expensive areas. My regression analysis found that if two homes are equal in every respect – same size, same distance from the beach, same amenities – but House A is going to have its premium increase by 100% more than House B, then House A will sell for 4% less than House B.

So, is climate risk priced in? Yes…but only a little bit. 

A home is the most expensive asset that most people own. If the value of a bunch of homes goes down at the same time, this causes big problems in the wider economy, even leading to a financial crisis. This is why insurance is so important: it acts as a canary in the coal mine of the climate crisis, bringing the future risk of climate change forward into today.
